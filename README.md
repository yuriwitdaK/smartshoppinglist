What i basically try to do is building a tool that helps planing budget for grocerys , recommending recipes ,helping you getting the best food for your money.
right now it makes decisions only based on what is the cheapest and i have like three recipes in the dictionairy.

--guess i`ll have to eat a lot of alfredo pasta--

i actually came across this problem where it just gives me the cheapest option wich is an algorithm problem so Ã¬ll have to implement an more advanced scoring system for the dishes wich brings me to the idea of implementing three more factors do you train? yes/no and what do you want Light/heavy ,challenging/guick and easy so the probability of the output beeing something you`ll actually cook get`s higher.

i might motivate myself for this project actually only eating what it suggests me

i need it to put out an error message instead of empty days
!!!it would be cool if it adds saved budget automatically to next weeks budget
also there should be a monthly recap and a saved total!!!

i added more recipes , an error message if the budget is exceedet and i forced more diversity in recipe output also i raised the budget to a hundred because 50 was to low for testing now i actually got a pretty solid plan and around 35 bucks leftover and pretty solid meal choices so the basic thing is workin

---i`ll need to take a look at the items in stock dictionairy and get the recipe function to properly work together,while doing that i should take a look at the suggestion algorithm to also include and value using items in stock maybe even try to also add an algorythm to evaluate the best days for shopping---

---i`m continously running into issues with the stock dicionairy, i need to add breakfast recipes---

---breakfast addet--- ---made it a soft commitment--- ---calories added,calories per day output--- ---recipe suggestion algorithm updated now half pricing/ half is it good for mealprepping and how many calories does it have---

still need to fix stock logic but overall i got a pretty effective tool now!

---had a lot of trouble with the sugggestion algorithm almost got it messed up again it really wanted me to eat 3 omelettes on a sunday---

made a differennce between weekend and weekday recipes
started savings algorithm

---to do---
!!!!!!!!fix stock logic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!savings algorithm!!!!!!!!!!!

stock logic fixed! :) had a pretty good idea for the savings algorithm and guess what -ran into some issues, never the less, added a calendar, reworked recipe suggestion in terms of breakfast added stock to the output tiny fix at the recipe algorithm i dont cook lasagna for breakfast

18.10.25
--to do--
!!!!!!!!!savings logic!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!savings output!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!! integrate leftover logic!!!!!!

guess what !!!!!!!!!!!!rework suggestion algortithm what do you mean cook lasagna for breakfast!!!!!!

19.10.2025
issue might not even be suggestion algorithm,i thougt making the 3 meals a day one list would do the job but i should rather make 3 seperate lists Breakfaast, Lunch, Dinner and work on seperate restrictions.

fixing savings logic in progress

savings output still unrealisticly high because of fictional monthly recap,should just cut it out



---to do--- del fictional recap
---create seperate lists for all meals
--- add more recipes---
integrate leftover logic, expiration logic implement warning, food expiring is bad for wallet and environment
ro


---improving writeup---
---explain functions in detail explain arguments and positioning---

---brainstorm---
