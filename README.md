What i basically try to do is building a tool that helps planing budget for grocerys , recommending recipes ,helping you getting the best food for your money.
right now it makes decisions only based on what is the cheapest and i have like three recipes in the dictionairy.

--guess i`ll have to eat a lot of alfredo pasta--

i actually came across this problem where it just gives me the cheapest option wich is an algorithm problem so Ã¬ll have to implement an more advanced scoring system for the dishes wich brings me to the idea of implementing three more factors do you train? yes/no and what do you want Light/heavy ,challenging/guick and easy so the probability of the output beeing something you`ll actually cook get`s higher.

i might motivate myself for this project actually only eating what it suggests me

i need it to put out an error message instead of empty days
!!!it would be cool if it adds saved budget automatically to next weeks budget
also there should be a monthly recap and a saved total!!!

i added more recipes , an error message if the budget is exceedet and i forced more diversity in recipe output also i raised the budget to a hundred because 50 was to low for testing now i actually got a pretty solid plan and around 35 bucks leftover and pretty solid meal choices so the basic thing is workin

---i`ll need to take a look at the items in stock dictionairy and get the recipe function to properly work together,while doing that i should take a look at the suggestion algorithm to also include and value using items in stock maybe even try to also add an algorythm to evaluate the best days for shopping---

---breakfast addet--- ---made it a soft commitment--- ---calories added,calories per day output--- ---recipe suggestion algorithm updated now half pricing/ half is it good for mealprepping and how many calories does it have---

still need to fix stock logic but overall i got a pretty effective tool now!

---had a lot of trouble with the sugggestion algorithm almost got it messed up again it really wanted me to eat 3 omelettes on a sunday---

made a differennce between weekend and weekday recipes
started savings algorithm

---to do---
!!!!!!!!fix stock logic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
