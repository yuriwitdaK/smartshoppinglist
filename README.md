What i basically try to do is building a tool that helps planing budget for grocerys , recommending recipes ,helping you getting the best food for your money.
right now it makes decisions only based on what is the cheapest and i have like three recipes in the dictionairy.

--guess i`ll have to eat a lot of alfredo pasta--

i actually came across this problem where it just gives me the cheapest option wich is an algorithm problem so Ã¬ll have to implement an more advanced scoring system for the dishes wich brings me to the idea of implementing three more factors do you train? yes/no and what do you want Light/heavy ,challenging/guick and easy so the probability of the output beeing something you`ll actually cook get`s higher.

i might motivate myself for this project actually only eating what it suggests me
